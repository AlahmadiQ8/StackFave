# Stackoverflow Chrome Extension

A chrome extension to easily braws through your starred stack-overflow questions. This project is hugely inspired by [octotree](https://github.com/buunguyen/octotree).

I started this project since I was stuggling to easily navigate through my starred stackoverflow questions. I tried [to search for a way and didn't find any](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3912/better-favourites-organisation). 

## Development

**For local development:**

    $ yarn install
    $ yarn start

**To install the extension, the steps below:** 

1. Run the build script below. This will generate the extension files in `dist` folder
    $ yarn install 
    $ yarn build
2. On Chrome, go to your extensions by visiting chrome://extensions/
3. Click on “Load Unpacked”, then select the `dist`  directory.
